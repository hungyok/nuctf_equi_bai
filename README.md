The repository folder "nuctf_equi_bai" has the data and codes to compute nucleosome abd TF occupancy. It has the following subfolders:

ndr_call

nuc_energy

NucTF

NucRemod

transf_yy_data

tf_energy_all ---> The TF energy is dumped in the folder: tf_energy_all\Etf_allmat_chr. Due to large data size, we have reported only the first three chromosome (Etf_chr1.mat, Etf_chr2.mat, and Etf_chr3.mat) and each has only the first 10 TFs from the listbai_all.txt.
